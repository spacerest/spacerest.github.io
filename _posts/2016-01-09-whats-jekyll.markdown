hey again! in my first post, i breezed over some stuff to lay down an intro to where i'm at right now. in this post, i'd like to explore my understanding of this generator i'm using, [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

some questions i'd like to answer in this post are:

1. what's its story? who made it, when, and why?
2. how does it work?
3. what are the different ways of utilizing it?
4. what are its limitations?
