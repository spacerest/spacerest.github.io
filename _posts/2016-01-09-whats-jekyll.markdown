In my first post, I breezed over some stuff to lay down an intro to where I'm at right now. In this post, I'd like to explore my understanding of this generator I'm using, [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Some questions I'd like to answer in this post are:

1. What's its story? who made it, when, and why?
2. How does it work?
3. What are the different ways of utilizing it?
4. What are its limitations?
