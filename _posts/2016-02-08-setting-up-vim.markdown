Hey there! Today I'd like to set up my vim environment to eliminate some of the extra steps I've been taking.

╚╚\|░▄░\|╝╝

1. My goals:
  - Have multiple vim windows up within one terminal window
  - Fix how syntax is displaying in my markdown files (some characters, like underscores in file names, can't be escaped and funk up the highlighting in the rest of my file)
  - 
2. How to fulfil the above goals.
3. What's next?
4. Conclusion and sources.
