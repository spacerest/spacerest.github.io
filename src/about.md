| Hey! My name is Sadie. I enjoy television, biking, playing and listening to music, and studying programming. This is a blog where I'm theoretically logging things I've been learning related to programming. I might add something else on, sometime. | ![picture of sadie](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16748263?v=3&s=460) |
